# salesAIBot

I built a tiny sales bot which can read items from your product catalog and show them to the customer based on their query.

I took the file from data.world (https://data.world/crawlfeeds/gamestop-products-list-dataset)

I have used OpenAI and Langchain to build an AI agent that can read the excel file and answer show them info from the file based on user's query in human panguage.
The agent is also able to carry out logical operations such as sum, group by etc. on the given data set.
